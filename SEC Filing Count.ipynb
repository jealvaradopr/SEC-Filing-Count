The goal is to count the number of filings in the SEC master.idx for that year and quarter for which the 'Company Name' entry satisfies the regular expression pattern.  This is perhaps best illustrated with an example.\n",

(I recommend using absolute paths, but not hardcoding the absolute paths. For example, after you have used $year$ and $quarter$ to construct $destfile$, you can write something like: 'url_destfile = os.path.abspath(os.path.join('./', destfile))'.)\n",

    "- Regardless of how much information you choose to retain from each line, please convert all letters in 'Company Name' to uppercase before performing the regex search.\n",
    "- In the example above, you would then use either <b>re.search()</b> or <b>findall()</b> to identify all company names that contain at least two consecutive digits.\n",
    "- If the number of regex matches is positive, return this number.\n",
    "- If there are no matches, return the number zero.\n",
    "- If the user requests an index that does not exist, such as <b>SEC_filing_count(1776, 4, '\\d\\d')</b>, return the number -1."
